      <description type="full">This series consists of specifications for contract works commissioned by the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage and the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. The records were created to provide evidence of the work undertaken and the standards that applied to that work. The Specifications begin in 1888, the year that the first Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was constituted. Water Specifications incorporated many different types of work, including the construction of cottages at reservoirs, raised reservoirs in suburbs, high pressure pipes for water supply, the supply of blue metal for roadways and stabilisation projects. Included in this series are specifications for the construction of a new head office for the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board in 1937. The contracts in this series begin at number 1 twice. Tthe first occasion is for the first contract in 1888 called by the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. The Specifications extend to number 1302 and begin again at number 1 at a time that coincides with the constitution of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. There are indexes to the Water Specifications contracts in the volumes from 1888 to 1895 (volumes 1 to 6). Contracts that begin with a "W" generally refer to work undertaken at Warragamba (for example volumes 260, 261, 262, etc). Some of the Specifications were not dated. The specifications are contained in bound volumes and arranged chronologically by volume and specification number.</description>

      <description type="brief">A Bayesian framework for frequency domain identification. The national and social benefits of the project will be reflected\r\nthrough the application recognition of the research work in the various industry and research community; and also through our international collaboration. The national and social benefits are also delivered by producing specialized researchers and engineers in systems and control engineering. These people include the research students who will participate in and learn from the proposed project.</description>
