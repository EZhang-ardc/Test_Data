                and variable costs. This concept is based on the assumption that the land is fully owned (100% equity).
                The unit of PFE is $/ha. The Data are provided as a raster dataset that is compatible with ArcGIS. The
                spatial resolution is ~ 1km. Values provided are not for individual commodities (e.g. wheat, barley
                etc.) but for a set of commodity classes known as SPREAD classes (e.g. winter cereals, winter oilseeds)
                and broad land use categories (grazing, natural pastures etc.). The Data do not provide information with
                regards to the associated land use. To link values of PFE to the associated land use (SPREAD class) the

                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Swedish Human Protein Atlas project, funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg
                Foundation, has been set up to allow for a systematic exploration of the human proteome using
                Antibody-Based Proteomics. This is accomplished by combining high-throughput generation of
                affinity-purified antibodies with protein profiling in a multitude of tissues and cells assembled in
                tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy analysis using human cell lines is performed for more detailed
                protein localization. The program hosts the Human Protein Atlas portal with expression profiles of human
                proteins in tissues and cells.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main sites are located at AlbaNova

                University, Uppsala, Sweden and Lab Surgpath, Mumbai, India. The main objective of the resource centre
                is to produce specific antibodies to human target proteins using a high-throughput production method
                involving the cloning and protein expression of Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs). After
                purification, the antibodies are used to study expression profiles in cells and tissues and for
                functional analysis of the corresponding proteins in a wide range of platforms. The Stockholm sites are
                responsible for generating high-quality antibodies and to perform the immunofluorescence analysis, the
                Uppsala site is responsible for large-scale protein profiling in tissues and cells using
                immunohistochemistry and the Mumbai site for the annotation of the immunohistochemistry images.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="brief">Aliens in the alps: predicting invasions and protecting native species. This
                project aims to investigate how warming and alien species invasions impact on Australia&#8217;s alpine
                ecosystems. Using a combination of methods from across the natural and physical sciences, this project
                endeavours to generate new knowledge on alpine biodiversity and the ability of native and alien species
                to cope with the pressures of climate warming and decreasing snow fall. Expected outcomes of this
                project include improved accuracy and precision in predicting the impacts of environmental change
                providing benefits to conservation planning and protection of the Australian Alps.
