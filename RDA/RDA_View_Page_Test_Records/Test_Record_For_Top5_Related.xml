           <description type="brief">The provided data (the Data) represent a raster map of agricultural profit at full equity (PFE) for Australia for the year 2005/06. Values of PFE are provided in ($/ha). PFE is a measure of profit which is calculated as the revenue from the sale of agricultural commodities minus all fixed and variable costs. This concept is based on the assumption that the land is fully owned (100% equity). The unit of PFE is $/ha. The Data are provided as a raster dataset that is compatible with ArcGIS. The spatial resolution is ~ 1km. Values provided are not for individual commodities (e.g. wheat, barley etc.) but for a set of commodity classes known as SPREAD classes (e.g. winter cereals, winter oilseeds) and broad land use categories (grazing, natural pastures etc.). The Data do not provide information with regards to the associated land use. To link values of PFE to the associated land use (SPREAD class) the Data need to be linked to the land use map of the year 2005/06 (Source: ABARE–BRS 2010. Land Use of Australia, Version 4, 2005-06 dataset).</description>

      <description type="brief">The rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ‘no-take’ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ‘no-take’ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities.  The results of reef surveys will be used to:
1. Track dynamics of populations of target fish species and by-catch species, such as reef sharks.
2. Track indirect effects of protection from fishing in terms of populations of non-target fish species. Since many exploited species are carnivorous, differences in their numbers may in turn affect the abundance of their prey (and potentially cause more extensive “trophic cascades”) as well as other community components that are related to resilience such as numbers of herbivorous fishes.
3. Track potential ecosystem effects of protection from fishing, such as increased coral recruitment and coral cover due to increased herbivorous fish numbers, and reduced incidence of coral disease (due to lower numbers of coral-feeding butterflyfishes inside no-take areas)</description>

      <description type="brief">The rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ‘no-take’ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ‘no-take’ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities.  The results of reef surveys will be used to:
1. Track dynamics of populations of target fish species and by-catch species, such as reef sharks.
2. Track indirect effects of protection from fishing in terms of populations of non-target fish species. Since many exploited species are carnivorous, differences in their numbers may in turn affect the abundance of their prey (and potentially cause more extensive “trophic cascades”) as well as other community components that are related to resilience such as numbers of herbivorous fishes.
3. Track potential ecosystem effects of protection from fishing, such as increased coral recruitment and coral cover due to increased herbivorous fish numbers, and reduced incidence of coral disease (due to lower numbers of coral-feeding butterflyfishes inside no-take areas)</description>
